This is my portfolio for the advanced GIS class!

# About me
Hello! My name is Matteo and I am currently a first year MSPPM-DA student at Heinz. I am currently taking the intro GIS course so I am still a bit new to the subject, but I have really been enjoying it so far. A little bit of background ...

I did my undergrad at CMU and graduated in 2023 with a Bachelor's in International Relations and Politics. In the year between then and when I started my Masters I was an AmeriCorps member at Cardozo Education Campus in D.C. where I thaught 10th Grade English. 

My two main policy interest is in transportation, but I am currently a research assistant on a regional economic development project so I am getting more interested in policies related to that. 

This is my second GitHub account! I actually had an assignment due yesterday (today is 03-19-2024 if you are reading in the future) for my ML class that was to set one up for that class so I went from 0 to 2 accounts in the span of less than 24 hours. 

Fun-facts: 
1. I grew up in Pittsburgh
2. I speak Italian because my parents were born there
3. My favorite food is not pasta

# What I hope to learn
I want to learn how to use GIS in a way that I can contribute to organizations. I think GIS is really fun and it would be cool if I could use it professionally.

# Portfolio
I would like some of my work here to be relevant to the research project that I mentioned above. I already used some GIS and this was probably my most useful contribution there. I am still not really sure what I want my final project to be. I learned a lot of lessons from my GIS mid-term and I would like it to be better than that one.
